### Installation

```sh
pip install range-ex
```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

If given numbers are integers you get a regex that will only match with integer and if floating-point numbers are given it only match with floating-point number.

Supports integer and floating-point numbers and negative range.

You can use `geq_regex` and `leq_regex` to generate regex for greater than or equal to and less than or equal to respectively (i.e., ranges without an upper or lower bound).

```python
from range_ex import range_regex, geq_regex, leq_regex
regex1 = range_regex(5,89)
regex2 = range_regex(81.78,250.23)
regex3 = range_regex(-65,12)

regex4 = geq_regex(5)
regex5 = leq_regex(89)
```

Example regex generated for 25-53
```
([3-4][0-9]|2[5-9]|5[0-3])
```


The regex might not be optimal but it will surely serve the purpose.
