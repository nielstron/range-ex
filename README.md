### Installation

```sh
pip install range-ex
```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Pass a minimum and maximum value to the `range_regex` function to generate a regex that matches numbers in that range. The range is inclusive, meaning both the minimum and maximum values are included in the regex.


Supports integer numbers and negative range.

```python
from range_ex import range_regex
regex1 = range_regex(5,89)
regex2 = range_regex(-65,12)

regex3 = range_regex(minimum=5)
regex4 = range_regex(maximum=89)
```

Example regex generated for 25-53
```
([3-4][0-9]|2[5-9]|5[0-3])
```

> Note: This will still find matches in strings like `1234` or `abc25def53`, so you may want to wrap it in `^` and `$` to match the whole string or `\b...\b` to ensure word boundaries are matched.
